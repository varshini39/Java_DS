Added codes related to data structure and algorithms in Java

Consider studying and building the following:

 1. Tree-based data structures like the red-black tree, trie, or self-balancing binary tree
 2. Binary and bitwise structures like bit fields and bitmasks

Consider looking into the following algorithms:

 1. A*, a variation on Dijkstra’s algorithm.
 2. Additional sorting algorithms like heapsort, shell sort, or radix sort
 3. Additional pathfinding algorithms, such as the Lee algorithm for searching through mazes
 4. String-searching and pattern-matching algorithms such as the Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) algorithm

In addition to building data structures and algorithms themselves, try applying them in new situations. Here are a few ideas to get you started

 1. Alter the sorting algorithms that you built in this course so that they take a comparator function and can sort anything instead of just numbers.
 2. Experiment with other hashing functions for your HashMap structure. Can you maximize the efficiency for different types of inputs with different hashing functions?

Consider building a project where using algorithms and data structures will be necessary in order to make the application efficient:

 1. A dictionary search or spellchecker
 2. A route-planning application
 3. An application for pairing work partners based on their shared interests
 4. A card game simulator in which you can shuffle the deck, maintain player hands, and keep track of the state of play
